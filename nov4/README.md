*The process:*

The first thing I did was put the LEDs in place and connect them to the wires and places Iâ€™ve chosen on the Arduino. I also put the ground and 5v wires in place. 


After knowing where all the wires were, I worked on the arduino code. My idea is that when the cup is not placed on the 'table' (aka. aluminum foil), the LED will be green. When it is placed back down, the red LED lights up to indicate for more tea.

*Difficulties:*


Some difficulties I faced while working on this homework is that I first got the error 'unable to upload to board'. I unattached the arduino wire from my laptop and put it back, and the arduino port appeared on the application. The error was that for some reason, the port was not available, but when I reattached it appeared and worked.

The second error I dealt with was that my LED lights were not working, but the board was responding.

It took me a while to figure out this error. I thought that maybe I placed the wires in the wrong place. After watching our recorded zoom lectures from October 26/28, I realized that I placed the resistors in the wrong place. I placed them to connect them with the ground and the LEDs worked!!

*In the end:

This project helped me get familiar with how arduino works, and how to connect wires in the correct places. At first, it was scary and I did not know where to begin. I realized that for me, planning out where all the wires and LEDs should be before working on the code makes things clearer and easier, because the hard part is out of the way.
