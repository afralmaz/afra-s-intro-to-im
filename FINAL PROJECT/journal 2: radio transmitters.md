Today, we worked on the radio transmitters and connecting them to the motors of our soon to be robot.

Connecting the radio transmitters was an easier process than we thought and we followed Michael's schematics to connect the radio transmitters to the two arduinos and bread boards.

Unknown parts we figured out today:

1. When we press the buttons that control the wheels through the radio, the wheels keep spinning nonstop. We are trying to figure out a code that stops the wheels from moving when the button is not pressed.

= Solution:

We created a stop button that will stop the wheels when you want it to stop. When it comes to processing, we will create a game controller that will have a stop button in the middle that people can interact with to move and stop the wheels.
