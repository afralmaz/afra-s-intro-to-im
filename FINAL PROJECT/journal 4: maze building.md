Items used:
- 5 foam boards 
- glue gun

:)

The process:

Since the flooring of the maze has to be 100x100 cm, I had to connect two foam boards together and make a base to hold everything together.

I then cut the measured parts and glued it together.

Difficulties?
- The only difficulties we faced was in the beginning where we did not know what materials to use exactly. 
- Another thing would be the stability of the borders but they are strongly glued to the base of the maze and other parts.

Results:

:D
