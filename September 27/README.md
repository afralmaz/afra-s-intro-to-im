For this week's assignment, I used generative text to try and depict BPD (borderline personality disorder) thoughts. I struggle with BPD and its often described to be black and white when it comes to dealing with emotions and thoughts (which is very true). So with this project, I tried my best to show how the two sides are completely opposite (happy & unhappy).

I split the page into a black colored and white colored side. I used the dark side to portray the unhappy thoughts and the white sad for what I believe to be good thoughts. 

I used the mousePressed function to generate different phrases on each side. The mouseX function was placed on both sides so words can only change when you click on the first letter, and not the entire page.

I feel like with each week, I understand how to place objects and accurate numbers to make it work, like with the mouseX function. It took a few tries and in the beginning the words were stuck together. I fixed my mistake by changing the "width/number" to place them where I wanted them to go. In the beginning of the semester, this was one of my fears and I feel like I overcame it this week :).

My referencing for this piece is the processing tutorials page for the mouseX function, and our lectures from the past week.
