For this week's homework, the process of creating the arduino board was a difficult task for me. 
I had a hard time understanding where exactly to put the wires and how to connect everything properly. My idea was to make the LDR sensor
flash when my hand is close to the sensor, and stop working when I press the button. The two LEDS are both connected to one button and one LDR. I had more complex ideas but because I am still
trying to understand and get used to working with all the wires and placements of LEDs and pins, it was hard for me to create what I 
was hoping to do.

Instead, this homework slowly helped me understand how to work with the breadboard. I went through many trials and errors making 
it work. I also discovered the application Fritzing to help me with mapping out where I should place the wires and LEDs for my brain
to wrap my mind around how this works.

My first schematic to try and see how a button and ldr sensor can work together:

The difficulties I ran into while working on this project was having trouble with the button working at times, because when I press it, it would sometimes work and sometimes not. I changed the circuit wires into different locations until I saw it work.

I also redid my board multiple times, I did not take photos during this process because I was too focused on trying to get the code and the arduino board to work in sync.

I want to get better at working with the arduino board and will have to put more time to work and understand how things work when it comes to building things on the arduino. 

My final project:
