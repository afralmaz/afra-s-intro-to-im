For this week's homework, the process of creating the arduino board was a difficult task for me. 
I had a hard time understanding where exactly to put the wires and how to connect everything properly. My idea was to make the LDR sensor
flash when my hand is close to the sensor, and stop working when I press the button. The two LEDS are both connected to one button and one LDR. I had more complex ideas but because I am still
trying to understand and get used to working with all the wires and placements of LEDs and pins, it was hard for me to create what I 
was hoping to do.

Instead, this homework slowly helped me understand how to work with the breadboard. I went through many trials and errors making 
it work.
