For this week's homework, we had to create a program on processing controlled by the arduino board. For my project, when you click on the circle, the LED flashes up.
When you move the potentimeter, the background colors change with every potentimeter. 

I found a website (https://maker.pro/arduino/tutorial/how-to-make-arduino-and-processing-ide-communicate) that taught me how to connect the potentimeter with processing.

For the LED, I wrote the code on processing that when mouse is clicked, the led lights up, else it is dimmed.

Difficulties:
- LED not lighting up, the solution was that I mistakingly put the short leg in the wrong place.
