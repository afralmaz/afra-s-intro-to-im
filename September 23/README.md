For this week's assignment, we focused on object oriented processing and trying out new things with arrays. At first, the concept of creating my own classes while programming me felt difficult because of the newness of it. I depended on our lecture and notes to create my artwork and understand the concept more in depth. 

Creating our own classes felt like a more organized method of writing code to summarize things and make it easier to know what we are creating, especially because we can name the classes what we want. The difficulty I faced with classes is making sure that what I'm coding is correct or not, I was afraid I was doing the wrong thing. I got a Null pointer Exception and found the solution to fix my class error from this website: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Preventing_NullPointerException

I also reused a code I used in my last project because I wanted to create a flickering circle grid in my project, and doing that helped me refresh my memory on everything we have been learning so far.
