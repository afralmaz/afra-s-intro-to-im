For this week's assignment, we focused on object oriented processing and trying out new things with arrays. At first, the concept of creating my own classes while programming me felt difficult because of the newness of it. I depended on our lecture and notes to create my artwork and understand the concept more in depth. 

Creating our own classes felt like a more organized method of writing code to summarize things and make it easier to know what we are creating, especially because we can name the classes what we want. The difficulty I faced with classes is making sure that what I'm coding is correct or not, I was afraid I was doing the wrong thing.

I also reused a code I used in my last project because I wanted to create a flickering circle grid in my project, and doing that helped me refresh my memory on everything we have been learning so far. 

My first idea was to create rain drops using arrays and classes, I watched a youtube video how, by the coding train, and it helped me understand classes more. What stopped me from continuing with my first draft was a null pointer exception error, and I figured out that it was a common and easy mistake fix using this website:https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Preventing_NullPointerException.

I always work on first drafts first to help me grasp the concept, then I work on my main idea. With the rain, I understood that when creating a class I have to assign things like this in order to begin a class:

class Rain{

float x;

float y;

float pos;

float length;

float speed;

This was the starting point, and everything went fairly okay after that.
