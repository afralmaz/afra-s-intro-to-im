For this week's assignment, we focused on object oriented processing and trying out new things with arrays. At first, the concept of creating my own classes while programming me felt difficult because of the newness of it. I depended on our lecture and notes to create my artwork and understand the concept more in depth. 

Creating our own classes felt like a more organized method of writing code to summarize things and make it easier to know what we are creating, especially because we can name the classes what we want.
