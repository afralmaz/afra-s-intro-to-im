Idea:
I’m thinking of creating a game that shows three important stages of life when it comes to appreciating yourself: realization, acceptance, and lastly self-love. 

Start page:
-	For the gradient background, I found a code from this youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbbG7v-4sew) and changed the color to make it a pink gradient. I also changed the starting place of the gradient to make it fit my canvas size.
-	I used the LoadFont instead of using the CreateFont function because I found it easier to use.

To change to the next page, I used the mouseClicked function to take the player to the game. My idea is to create squares around the page. The player can interact with the squares by the mouseX, mouseY function to explore the page. Each circle will take the player to a “journey to self love”.

Game page:

Currently, I'm struggling with how to be able to make each box change into something else with the mouseXY function, but I did make it work once. It will be a challenge fix it this time because I'm not sure if a mouseXY function can exist within a mouseClicked function.

*Progress photos so far:

I have the layout of the game complete, what I need to do now is work on the three pages, and find away to link them all together. I will try to figure out a way where I can go back and forth in the game, like make a button that takes you to different pages.
