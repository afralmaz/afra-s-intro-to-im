__Midterm__

To me, the midterm project was more than an assignment. While working on the project, I explored parts about myself that I did not expect to in this class, but am glad I did. It is an exploration to what I feel like are the three stages to self love: realization, acceptance, and finally love.

While working on this project, my first draft of code (uploaded as journal 1) was all based on the draw function, without other classes. After my meeting with Michael, I created classes to make it easier to create the game and that became my final code.

In the realization stage, I created an animation that resembled a beating heart. For the pink circle that grows and shrinks, I took some code from this link (https://gist.github.com/AHicks/5202330), and made a few changes so it can fit my project.

In the acceptance stage, I created a photo array of images I wanted to display. This took me a lot of trial and errors, and at first, but I combined two different codes to make it work:

1. https://gist.github.com/AHicks/5202330

- I referenced the code when creating the array of images. It was clear and basic enough for me to be able to implement it into my project in a clean way. This code only made the images appear in my program when I pressed a button but would dissapear if I did not, so I had to find a way to fix this issue. 

2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67512581/processing-mousepressed

- I used this code to fix the issue I was having and let the images appear in a sequence of order. I created integers for the first and last images, and a boolean to show and hide the images that appeared.
