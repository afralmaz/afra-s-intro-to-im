For our final project, I am teaming up with my classmate Sonny to build a robot that can be controlled from processing. 
We will be using two arduino connected to a radio from two bread board to make the robot move around through processing. 

We split the process of building the robot into different stages:

*Stage one:*

Work on the DC motors to make sure they are moving and try controlling it through processing.

*Stage two:*

Connect the radio and test it out to have the robot move around to different spaces without being connected to the arduino wire.

*Stage three:*

- Design and build the robot. 
- Connect the arduino with the radio, DC motors, and breadboard onto the robot.
